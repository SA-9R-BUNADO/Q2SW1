He's a sweet guy and the best boyfriend to Lori - the eldest sister in the Loud family. He is the standard. He shows basic respect for everyone and has never done not one bad thing in the show. It really shows how a man was raised based on their actions. He was raised by his mom, together with his sister. We need more men like him in real life who can actually treat women right. </td>

She's kind, helpful, and a well rounded girl. She and her brother should have more recognition. They're often being shadowed off by their show partner. She's so much more than just Lincoln's (From the Loud family's) partner. She's a talented kid who deserves to be more than just a side character. </td>

They are kind, giving, and selfless people who are willing to give up everything for their child, Clyde. They can be overprotective sometimes but it's all for a good cause. They want to keep their child safe which is every parents' aim for their children. They raise their kid fine and teach him good morality. </td>

He's a really sweet child who cares about the environment a lot. He was raised in a good household with loving parents. He was taught good morals ever since then which explains why he's a big crowd favorite. He is full of love, and willing to give that love away to others because that's who he is as a person.</td>
